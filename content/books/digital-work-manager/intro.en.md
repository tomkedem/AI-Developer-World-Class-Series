# Introduction

This book was written for developers who work with AI tools for writing code, or are about to start, and feel that something in their work has changed, even if they do not yet have a clear name for it.

This is not another tool guide, and not a collection of prompt tricks.  
It is a book about work. About responsibility. And about control.

In an era where code agents can read an entire repository, run commands, change files, and build features, the developer’s role no longer ends with writing code. It shifts toward execution management: defining goals, setting boundaries, critically reviewing results, and making decisions.

This book is for those who want to remain professional in that kind of world.  
Not to fight the new tools, but also not to give up judgment, quality, or responsibility.

It is written as a working book. You do not have to read it from start to finish in one go. You can stop, skip, return, and apply ideas while working on a real project. The examples and principles are based on day to day work with code agents in real projects, not lab style demos.

If you are looking for a list of commands or shortcuts, this is probably not the book for you.

If you are looking for a way to work with code agents in a controlled, responsible, and effective manner, and to turn them into part of your development team rather than something you merely “use”, you are in the right place.

From here, the book moves to the opening chapter, where we break down the core shift in software development work and build a shared language for what comes next.
