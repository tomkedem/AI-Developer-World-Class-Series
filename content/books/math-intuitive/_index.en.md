# Intuitive Math for AI-Era Developers

Written by: **Tomer Kedem**

Version 4.6 | 2025

This book is part of a broader mission: giving developers a clear, human way to understand the mathematical ideas that shape modern AI.  
Not academic math. Not proofs for the sake of proofs.  
Just the pieces that matter when you build real systems.

The goal is simple:  
to take concepts that usually feel heavy and turn them into tools you can actually use.  
Vectors, probabilities, similarity, gradients.  
Not as formulas, but as ways to think.

If you ever felt that “math for AI” belongs רק למדענים — this book is here to prove otherwise.  
Everything inside is built for developers who write code daily, think in systems, and want to understand how the models they use actually *reason*.

Welcome to a different kind of math.  
Clear. Practical. Human.
