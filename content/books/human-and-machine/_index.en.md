# Human and Machine – The Developer in the Age of Agents

This is the first booklet in the series.  
It sets the starting point for everything that follows.

Software development has changed.  
Large models, code-generating tools and autonomous agents now work alongside us,  
and the role of the developer is shifting from “writing code” to  
**designing, directing and validating systems that work with intelligent tools**.

This booklet introduces a calm, practical approach to working with AI.  
Not out of fear, and not by blindly trusting the model,  
but by understanding what has truly changed and what stays in our hands.

## What You Will Learn

• How the meaning of “writing code” has changed when models can write entire blocks for you  
• The difference between a developer, a model director and an autonomous agent  
• How to use AI tools responsibly: asking the right questions, not just reading the output  
• New workflows: Human in the Loop, AI-assisted pair coding and smarter code review  
• How to detect logical mistakes even when the code looks perfect  
• Professional responsibility and system-level thinking in an AI-driven environment  
• Clear boundaries: what the model can do, what it cannot, and what remains human judgment

## Why This Matters

AI does not replace developers.  
It **reshapes** the way developers work.

To build stable and controlled systems, you need to understand:

• Where models are strong  
• Where they fail  
• And how to integrate them without breaking your architecture  

The ideas in this booklet support the entire rest of the series: Python, math, RAG, Agents and production systems.

## Who This Is For

For developers who want to work correctly in the age of AI.  
No advanced background required.  
Just curiosity, critical thinking, and a willingness to update old habits.

## Final Project – mini_hybrid_dev

You will build a small software component together with an AI agent.

The process includes:

• Defining the goal and constraints  
• Receiving an initial solution from the agent  
• Performing human review and improvements  
• Documenting the hybrid workflow  

The goal is to understand how real collaboration between a human and an AI agent works.

## Continue to the Next Booklet

After this booklet, you’ll move on to "Practical Python for the Age of AI" —  
the technical foundation you will use throughout the series.
