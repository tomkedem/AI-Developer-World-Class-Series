In a world where intelligent models can write code, analyze text and perform complex tasks,  
the role of the developer is changing.  
Not disappearing – changing.

This series gives developers a clear, practical path for working in the age of AI:  
understanding what models can do, what they cannot do, and how to integrate them safely  
into real systems without breaking architecture, logic or control.

The focus is on practice.  
No unnecessary theory, no heavy math, no academic detours.  
Each booklet adds one concrete skill, and together they build a professional foundation  
for real AI development – from understanding, to integrating models, to deploying them in production.
